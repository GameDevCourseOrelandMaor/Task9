Code based on the [Fusion Shared Mode Tutorial](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/tutorials/shared-mode-basics/overview).

## Changes

- We added a shield that protects the first player who picks it up for 10 seconds.
- We added a score tracker to monitor the player's hits in raycast only.
- We added rockets that decrease 5 health points with a right click of the mouse.
